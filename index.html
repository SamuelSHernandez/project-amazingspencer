        <h2>Topic Overview</h2>

        <p>
            Around February 2020, rumors began to spread of a certain virus that could have devastading consequences.
            In March 2020, the coronavirus made its debut and had spread to the United States.
            The coronavirus causes symptoms of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever or chills, cough,
            fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose,
            nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. Symptoms listed here are from the <a
                href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">CDC</a>.
            In an attempt to slow the spread, the country was shut down for months and preventative measures were put
            into place to slow the spread. Now after being shut down, the country is beginning to reopen and businesses
            are opening their doors with preventative measures still in place. These preventive measures include wearing
            face masks and social distancing. As Americans are getting back into the office and perhaps going to the
            grocery store
            for the first time in months, Americans need to know the extent of this virus and what the stats of the
            coronavirus are.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">CDC
                recommends</a>
            that you wash your hands often, avoid close contact, cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around
            others,
            cover coughs and sneezes, clean and disinfect, and monitor your health daily to prevent contracting the
            coronavirus.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">John Hopkins University</a> provides a global map of
            coronavirus hotspots and known locations. This site also
            includes number of cases, number of deaths, and trends for the virus.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe that there is a real need for web applications for the coronavirus. People want to be able to
            visit
            a site that will inform and provide updated statistics on the extent of the coronavirus. People want to be
            able to quickly and easily locate information related to the coronavirus. People will also want to see how
            their local governments are handling this virus and the web app could provide links to local government
            sites.

        <h2>Potential Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Coronavirus Information Site</li>
            <li>Disease Information Site</li>
            <li>Forget-the-Coronavirus Site</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Coronavirus Information Site</h3>
        <p>The Coronavirus Information Site will include statistical data about the number of cases, number
            of deaths, geographical information such as maps that show hotspots, as well as articles from reliable
            sources
            on the coronavirus. To use the app, all it takes is visiting the site and exploring the content and
            information
            available at your fingertips. Users will be able to navigate to a map graphic, access articles, and be able
            to see
            coronavirus stats provided by reliable sources such as the CDC.
        </p>

        <h3>Disease Information Site</h3>
        <p>
            The Disease Information Site will be similar in style to the Coronavirus Information Site with the primary
            difference
            being that this site will be more broad in scope. This site will have a listing for major diseases in the
            United States
            and pertinent facts and information regarding each of those diseases. The site will also include map data
            and graphics
            pertaining to each disease listed.
        </p>

        <h3>Forget-the-Coronavirus Site</h3>
        <p>
            The Forget-the-Coronavirus Site is a site that will be a place to get your mind off of the coronavirus and
            all of the world's
            problems. Sometimes we as humans focus so much on the negative of what is happening around us that sometimes
            we need to take
            a break and focus on the positive. To accomplish that, this site will provide uplifting articles for
            reading, interactive games
            and puzzles, and links to other positive sites. Users will be able to visit this site to take their mind off
            of the negative
            and focus on the positive.
