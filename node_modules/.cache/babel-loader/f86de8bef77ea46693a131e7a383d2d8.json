In March 2020, the coronavirus made its debut and had\n                                spread to the United States. In an attempt to slow the spread, the country was\n                                shut down for months and preventative measures were put into place to slow the\n                                spread. Now after being shut down, the country is beginning to reopen and\n                                businesses are opening their doors with preventative measures still in place.\n                                These preventive measures include wearing face masks and social distancing.

Crowded\n                                conditions can let viruses from different animals swap genes. Sometimes the virus changes so much it can\n                                start to infect and spread among people. Still, the Wuhan market didn't sell bats at the time of the\n                                outbreak. That’s why early suspicion also fell on pangolins, also called scaly anteaters, which are sold\n                                illegally in some markets in China. Some coronaviruses that infect pangolins are similar to SARS-CoV-2 (a coronavirus).\n                                As SARS-CoV-2 spread both inside and outside China, it infected people who have had no direct contact\n                                with animals. That meant the virus is transmitted from one human to another. It’s now spreading in the\n                                U.S. and around the globe, meaning that people are unwittingly catching and passing on the coronavirus.\"\n                            </p>\n                        </section>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"container\">\n                        <section id=\"symptoms\">\n                            <h2>Symptoms</h2>\n                            <p>\n                                The coronavirus causes symptoms of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever or chills, cough,\n                                fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose,\n                                nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea.

This means that to spread\n                    from\n                    person to person, individuals are likely within 6 feet of each other, close to someone who is\n                    coughing\n                    or sneezing. When a person coughs or sneezes, respiratory droplets are produced and can travel\n                    through\n                    the air and into the mouths or noses of nearby people. Recent studies also suggest that COVID-19\n                    may\n                    also be spread between people not showing symptoms.\n                </p>\n\n                        </section>\n                    </div>\n                </main>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
