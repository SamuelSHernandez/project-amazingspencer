In March 2020, the coronavirus made its debut and had\n                                spread to the United States. In an attempt to slow the spread, the country was\n                                shut down for months and preventative measures were put into place to slow the\n                                spread. Now after being shut down, the country is beginning to reopen and\n                                businesses are opening their doors with preventative measures still in place.\n                                These preventive measures include wearing face masks and social distancing. As\n                                Americans are getting back into the office and perhaps going to the grocery store\n                                for the first time in months, Americans need to know the extent of this virus and\n                                what the stats of the coronavirus are.\n                            </p>\n\n                            <p>\n                                Currently, the <cite><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html\">\n                                    CDC recommends</a></cite> that you wash your hands often, avoid close contact, cover your mouth and nose with a\n                                mask when around others, cover coughs and sneezes, clean and disinfect, and monitor your health daily to prevent\n                                contracting the coronavirus.\n                            </p>\n\n                            <p>\n                                <cite><a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">John Hopkins University</a></cite> provides a global map of\n                                coronavirus hotspots and known locations.

According to <cite><a\n                                    href=\"https://www.webmd.com/lung/coronavirus-history\">WebMD</a></cite>, the coronavirus began in what is called\n                                a \"wet-market,\" where fresh meat and fish is sold daily and some animals sold are killed on the spot.\n                                \"Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like cobras, wild boars, and raccoon dogs. Crowded\n                                conditions can let viruses from different animals swap genes. Sometimes the virus changes so much it can\n                                start to infect and spread among people. Still, the Wuhan market didn't sell bats at the time of the\n                                outbreak. That’s why early suspicion also fell on pangolins, also called scaly anteaters, which are sold\n                                illegally in some markets in China. Some coronaviruses that infect pangolins are similar to SARS-CoV-2 (a coronavirus).\n                                As SARS-CoV-2 spread both inside and outside China, it infected people who have had no direct contact\n                                with animals. That meant the virus is transmitted from one human to another. It’s now spreading in the\n                                U.S. and around the globe, meaning that people are unwittingly catching and passing on the coronavirus.\"\n                            </p>\n                        </section>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"container\">\n                        <section id=\"symptoms\">\n                            <h2>Symptoms</h2>\n                            <p>\n                                The coronavirus causes symptoms of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever or chills, cough,\n                                fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose,\n                                nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea.

This means that to spread from\n                                person to person, individuals are likely within 6 feet of each other, close to someone who is coughing\n                                or sneezing. When a person coughs or sneezes, respiratory droplets are produced and can travel through\n                                the air and into the mouths or noses of nearby people. Recent studies also suggest that COVID-19 may\n                                also be spread between people not showing symptoms.\n                            </p>\n                        </section>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"container\">\n                        <section id=\"timeline\">\n                            <h2>Timeline of the Coronavirus</h2>\n                <figure>\n                                <img src=\"img/flags.jpg\" alt=\"Flags of countries\"/>\n                                    <figcaption>Photo by <cite><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kaung_myat_min\">Kaung Myat\n                                Min</a></cite>.\n                    </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                                <p>\n                                    The coronavirus began in Wuhan, China during late 2019.
