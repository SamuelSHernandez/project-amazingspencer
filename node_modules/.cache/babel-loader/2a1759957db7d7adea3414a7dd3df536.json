According to <cite><a\n                                        href=\"https://www.webmd.com/lung/coronavirus-history\">WebMD</a></cite>, the coronavirus began in what is called\n                                a \"wet-market,\" where fresh meat and fish is sold daily and some animals sold are killed on the spot.\n                                \"Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like cobras, wild boars, and raccoon dogs. Crowded\n                                conditions can let viruses from different animals swap genes. Sometimes the virus changes so much it can\n                                start to infect and spread among people. Still, the Wuhan market didn't sell bats at the time of the\n                                outbreak. That’s why early suspicion also fell on pangolins, also called scaly anteaters, which are sold\n                                illegally in some markets in China. Some coronaviruses that infect pangolins are similar to SARS-CoV-2 (a coronavirus).\n                                As SARS-CoV-2 spread both inside and outside China, it infected people who have had no direct contact\n                                with animals. That meant the virus is transmitted from one human to another. It’s now spreading in the\n                                U.S. and around the globe, meaning that people are unwittingly catching and passing on the coronavirus.\"\n                            </p>\n                            </section>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className=\"container\">\n                            <section id=\"symptoms\">\n                                <h2>Symptoms</h2>\n                                <p>\n                                    The coronavirus causes symptoms of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever or chills, cough,\n                                    fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose,\n                                nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea.
