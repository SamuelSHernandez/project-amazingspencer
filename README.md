# Coronavirus Web Application

The coronavirus has upended our lives and sent the world into a lockdown mode. The aim of this website will be to provide informative and helpful information on the coronavirus including number of cases, deaths, a map graphic, and reliable articles. The website presented currently explores this and other possible web applications that could be made in light of the coronavirus.

## Stage-2 Improvements

For stage-2, CSS and more HTML has been added to improve the overall look and functionality of the site. In particular, several features have been added to increase the design complexity of the site.

### New site features:
* Parallax scrolling
* Bootstrap navbar with custom styles
* Extensive iconography using Font Awesome in navbar
* Responsive containers using Bootstrap
* Bootstrap card with styled contact button
* Box shadows around images
* Various styling adjustments (i.e. fonts, and background colors)

## Stage-3 Improvement

### Survey.js

To implement the survey, I utilized Survey.js, which allowed me to create and set up my survey at https://surveyjs.io/create-survey. Once set up, I included the necessary JavaScript and HTML code to make it appear within the website. This was a fantastic way of adding a survey to my site. I saved a ton of time and created something that looks good on both mobile and desktop.

### Google Map Coronavirus API
#### Implemented by Samuel Hernadez

As part of the coronavirus web application, Samuel Hernadez was able to implement a Google Map API that shows the user coronavirus stats for each country. The user views this information by clicking on a blue dot that is found within the borders of the country. The idea of utilizing a map like this, is to give users of the site an idea of how other countries are doing with the coronavirus.
